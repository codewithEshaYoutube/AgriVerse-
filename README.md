## 🌾 Mission Overview  

The agriculture community faces a universal challenge: integrating space data into daily farming for sustainability.  
Our solution — **AgriVerse** — turns **NASA Earth observation APIs** into an **interactive educational simulator** that helps users visualize how **climate, irrigation, and soil patterns** affect global crop yield.  

> 🛰️ *Yes, this app talks directly to NASA’s APIs — real data, real-time.*  
> From orbit to orchard. 🌎
