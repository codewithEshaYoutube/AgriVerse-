## 🌾 Mission Overview  

The agriculture community faces a universal challenge: integrating space data into daily farming for sustainability.  
Our solution — **AgriVerse** — transforms **NASA Earth Observation APIs** into an **interactive educational simulator**, allowing users to explore how **climate, irrigation, and soil conditions** influence global crop yields.  

> 🛰️ *Yes, this app uses real NASA APIs — authenticated via NASA Earthdata Login.*  
> From orbit to orchard, we bring **space data down to Earth.** 🌾
